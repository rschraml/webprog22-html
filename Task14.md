<article>
<aside>
<hr>
<mark>
```

## tertiary.html

Reproduce this webpage as **tertiary-01.html**: [Tertiary No. 1](pdfs/tertiary-01.pdf)

The ordered list is navigation, so indicate that. In that navigation…

- the word “Chartreuse” always links to the latest version of your Chartreuse page
- the word “Home” always links to the latest version of the Home (index) page

**Furthermore:**

- The `<title>` is Tertiary :: Colors.
- The content above the horizontal rule is an article. Mark it up as such.
- There are two instances of highlighted text on the page. Mark them up appropriately.
- The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.

## index.html

Create **index-02.html** by duplicating **index-01.html** & update **index-02.html** as follows.

- Update your navigation with the proper links.
- The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.
- Everything that’s not in navigation or the page’s footer is in an article, so mark it up as such.

Your **index-02.html** page will look like this: [Index No. 2](pdfs/index-02.pdf). Visually, you should see no difference from Index No. 1!

## chartreuse.html

Create **chartreuse-05.html** by duplicating **chartreuse-04.html** & update **chartreuse-05.html** as follows.

- Update your navigation with the proper links.
- The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.
- We’re about to mark up the main content of the page as an article, & navigation doesn’t belong in there, so you need to move navigation above the article.
- The following implied section (notice the word implied) should go in an aside, as one day it’s going to become a sidebar: Chartreuse (web color). Make sure you think about how much content that implied section contains!
- Everything that’s not in navigation, an aside, or the page’s footer is in an article, so mark it up as such.

Your **chartreuse-05.html** page will look like this: [Chartreuse No. 5](pdfs/chartreuse-05.pdf). Visually, you should see no difference from Chartreuse No. 4!
