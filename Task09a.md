## Task09a
Create a new file named **chartreuse-00a.html**.
In this file reproduce the content of Pre-Chartreuse No. 1. Copy the text from the [PDF](pdfs/pre-chartreuse-01.pdf).

This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment:
```
<html>
<head>
<body>
<title>
<p>
<br>
```
Remember, `<title>` is not what you see in the viewport—that would be an `<h1>` (which you will learn about shortly). So how do you figure out what the `<title>` would be? Remember what is on the slide for `<title>` in the Web Development: The Absolute Basics presentation: “Humans see that title on tabs”. Unfortunately, you’re getting a PDF to copy, so you can’t see what’s in `<title>`, so, out of the goodness of my heart, I’ll help you out & tell you that the `<title>` is Chartreuse :: Colors.
