## 1.
Create a new file named Chartreuse00.html
In this file reproduce the content of Pre-Chartreuse No. 12. Copy the text from the PDF.



This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment.
HTML
'''
<html>
<head>
<body>
<title>
<p>
<br>
'''
Remember, '<title>' is not what you see in the viewport—that would be an '<h1>' (which you will learn about shortly). So how do you figure out what the <title> would be? Remember what is on the slide for <title> in the Web Development: The Absolute Basics presentation: “Humans see that title on tabs”. Unfortunately, you’re getting a PDF to copy, so you can’t see what’s in <title>, so, out of the goodness of my heart, I’ll help you out & tell you that the <title> is Chartreuse :: Colors.
