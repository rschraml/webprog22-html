## 1. Chartreuse00.html
Create a new file named Chartreuse00.html
In this file reproduce the content of Pre-Chartreuse No. 12. Copy the text from the PDF.



This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment.

HTML
```
<html>
<head>
<body>
<title>
<p>
<br>
```
Remember, `<title>`is not what you see in the viewport—that would be an '<h1>' (which you will learn about shortly). So how do you figure out what the <title> would be? Remember what is on the slide for <title> in the Web Development: The Absolute Basics presentation: “Humans see that title on tabs”. Unfortunately, you’re getting a PDF to copy, so you can’t see what’s in <title>, so, out of the goodness of my heart, I’ll help you out & tell you that the <title> is Chartreuse :: Colors. 

  
## 2.Chartreuse01.html
Duplicate Chartreuse00.html and rename it to Chartreuse01.html.

Reproduce this webpage: Pre-Chartreuse No. 22. Copy the text from the PDF.

This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment (of course, you will also use some—maybe all—of the elements you used in the last assignment as well!).

```
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
<dd>
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
``` 

Don’t forget that there is a difference between the `<title>` in the `<head> & the title that humans see in the viewport.

## 3.Chartreuse02.html
  
  


This assignment introduces the following elements & concepts. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment.

    <nav>
    internal linking
    placeholder images

index.html

Create the following webpages in the colors project. For each of these 3 pages, use the Templates extension to create a simple HTML5 page. That is the only content you need to have on these 3 pages at this time.

    primary.html (<title> is Primary :: Colors)
    secondary.html (<title> is Secondary :: Colors)
    tertiary-01.html (<title> is Tertiary :: Colors)

OK, now for the main part of the assignment.

Create a new file in your colors project: index-01.html

Reproduce this webpage index-01.html: Index No. 1.

The <title> is Colors.

The numbered list at the top is actually going to be the main navigation on the website, so indicate that accordingly.

In that navigation, the word “Chartreuse” always links to the latest version of your Chartreuse page.

Use the Placeholder Images extension for VSCode to add the images. To use it, invoke the Command Palette (⌘⇧P on Mac & Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows) & type Placeholder Images: Insert New Image. I recommend using Unsplash, but it’s up to you.

All of the following share a link, to primary.html:

    The placeholder image above Primary Colors
    The header text: Primary Colors
    The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

All of the following share a link, to secondary.html:

    The placeholder image above Secondary Colors
    The header text: Secondary Colors
    The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

All of the following share a link, to tertiary-01.html:

    The placeholder image above Tertiary Colors
    The header text: Tertiary Colors
    The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

chartreuse.html

Now go back to your Chartreuse webpage, which is chartreuse-03.html at this point. Duplicate it & name the new one chartreuse-04.html.

The numbered list at the top is actually going to be the main navigation on the website, so indicate that accordingly.

In that navigation, the word “Home” always links to the latest version of your new Home page (index-01.html in this case).

This page should now look like this: Chartreuse No. 4

Of course, this means you’re going to need to go back to index-01.html & change the link to Chartreuse in the navigation (to chartreuse-04.html in this case)!



This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment. However, you will not use every one of these elements on every page.

<footer>

<article>

<aside>

<hr>

<mark>
tertiary.html

Reproduce this webpage as tertiary-01.html: Tertiary No. 1

The ordered list is navigation, so indicate that. In that navigation…

    the word “Chartreuse” always links to the latest version of your Chartreuse page
    the word “Home” always links to the latest version of the Home (index) page

The <title> is Tertiary :: Colors.

The content above the horizontal rule is an article. Mark it up as such.

There are two instances of highlighted text on the page. Mark them up appropriately.

The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.
index.html

Create index-02.html by duplicating index-01.html & update index-02.html as follows.

Update your navigation with the proper links.

The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.

Everything that’s not in navigation or the page’s footer is in an article, so mark it up as such.

Your index-02.html page will look like this: Index No. 2. Visually, you should see no difference from Index No. 1!
chartreuse.html

Create chartreuse-05.html by duplicating chartreuse-04.html & update chartreuse-05.html as follows.

Update your navigation with the proper links.

The following implied sections (notice the word implied) are all in the page’s footer, so mark them up appropriately: Contact, Socialize, Tools, News.

We’re about to mark up the main content of the page as an article, & navigation doesn’t belong in there, so you need to move navigation above the article.

The following implied section (notice the word implied) should go in an aside, as one day it’s going to become a sidebar: Chartreuse (web color). Make sure you think about how much content that implied section contains!

Everything that’s not in navigation, an aside, or the page’s footer is in an article, so mark it up as such.

Your chartreuse-05.html page will look like this: Chartreuse No. 5. Visually, you should see no difference from Chartreuse No. 4!

Setting up

Create a new folder in the colors projects & call it css. In the css folder, create a file called main-01.css.

Duplicate chartreuse-05.html & call it chartreuse-06.html.

Duplicate index-02.html & call it index-03.html.

Duplicate tertiary-01.html & call it tertiary-02.html.

Link main-01.css to chartreuse-06.html, index-03.html, & tertiary-02.html.
Specific CSS

The figures in chartreuse-06.html are too close together. Insert a margin under each one that is 2.5em in size.

Make every nav have a background color of yellow & a font of Verdana, a sans-serif font.

Make every article have a background color of pink & a font of Georgia, a serif font.

Make every aside have a background color of silver & a font of Courier (if you use a Mac) or Courier New (if you use Windows), a monospace font.

Make every footer have a background color of yellow & a font of Verdana, a sans-serif font.

On index-03.html:

    the words “Cras justo odio” are alerts that need to be red & bold, so use CSS to style them accordingly.
    all instances of h3 inside a (anchor) elements (& only h3s that are inside as) need to have a bottom border that is 1px in width, dotted, & has a color of red.
  
  
  
      
      
<a>

You will be adding 3 kinds of values for the href attribute in your <a> elements (for details about how to do each one, search the HTML Overview slides & notes):

    mailto (to test, read A guide to getting webmail services to work with mailto links for instructions on setting up your browser to send mailto links to webmail services like Gmail & Yahoo Mail)
    Absolute URL
    Fake links that don’t actually go anywhere (the last 2 links on the page; instructions are in the slides—search for them)
