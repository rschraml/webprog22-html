## Task09a
Create a new file named **chartreuse-00b.html**.
In this file reproduce the content of Pre-Chartreuse No. 2. Copy the text from the [PDF](pdfs/pre-chartreuse-02.pdf).


This assignment introduces the following elements. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment (of course, you will also use some—maybe all—of the elements you used in the last assignment as well!).
Duplicate Chartreuse00.html and rename it to Chartreuse01.html.
```
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
<dd>
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
```
Don’t forget that there is a difference between the `<title>` in the `<head>` the title that humans see in the viewport.
