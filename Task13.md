## Task13
This assignment introduces the following elements & concepts. You should use every one of these elements in order to complete the assignment.
```
    <nav>
    internal linking
    placeholder images
```

## index.html

Create the following webpages in the project folder. For each of these 3 pages, use the autocomplete-snippets package [LINK](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-snippets) to create the html boilerplate. You should have installed it already in Task 08. Simply write html and press enter. That is the only content you need to have on these 3 pages at this time.

- **primary.html** (<title> is Primary :: Colors)
- **secondary.html** (<title> is Secondary :: Colors)
- **tertiary-01.html** (<title> is Tertiary :: Colors)

OK, now for the main part of the assignment. Create a new file in your colors project: `index-01.html`. Reproduce this webpage index-01.html: [Index No. 1](pdfs/index-01.pdf). The `<title>` is Colors.

- The numbered list at the top is actually going to be the main navigation on the website, so indicate that accordingly.
- In that navigation, the word “Chartreuse” always links to the latest version of your Chartreuse page.
- Use the [placeholder images extension](https://atom.io/packages/img-placeholder) to add the images. Find out yourself how to use it.

### All of the following share a link, to primary.html:

- The placeholder image above Primary Colors
- The header text: Primary Colors
- The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

### All of the following share a link, to secondary.html:

- The placeholder image above Secondary Colors
- The header text: Secondary Colors
- The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

### All of the following share a link, to tertiary-01.html:

- The placeholder image above Tertiary Colors
- The header text: Tertiary Colors
- The text: Cras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam. Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

## chartreuse.html

Now go back to your Chartreuse webpage, which is **chartreuse-03.html** at this point. Duplicate it & name the new one **chartreuse-04.html**.

- The numbered list at the top is actually going to be the main navigation on the website, so indicate that accordingly.
- In that navigation, the word “Home” always links to the latest version of your new Home page (**index-01.html** in this case).

This page should now look like this: [Chartreuse No. 4](pdfs/chartreuse-04.pdf)

Of course, this means you’re going to need to go back to index-01.html & change the link to Chartreuse in the navigation (to **chartreuse-04.html** in this case)!
