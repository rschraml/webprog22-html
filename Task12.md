## Task12
Right-click on **chartreuse-03.html**, duplicate it, & name it **chartreuse-04.html**.

Reproduce this webpage in Brackets: [Chartreuse No. 3](pdfs/chartreuse-03.pdf).

This assignment introduces the following elements. **You should use every one of these elements** in order to complete the assignment (of course, you will also use some—maybe all—of the elements you used in previous assignments as well!).
```
<a>
```
You will be adding 3 kinds of values for the **href** attribute in your `<a>` elements (for details about how to do each one, have a look at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)):

- mailto (to test, read a guide to getting webmail services to work with mailto links for instructions on setting up your browser to send mailto links to webmail services like Gmail & Yahoo Mail)
- Absolute URL
- Fake links that don’t actually go anywhere (the last 2 links on the page)
